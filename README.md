## FiveByFive Badge - a 5x5 LED badge

### Brief Introduction
The fivebyfive badge is an electronic kit that runs on a coin battery.
It was a popular soldering project from about 2012-2016 in various venues where we
ran soldering workshops.
A number of friends helped in the effort, and I want to acknowledge them here:
Miloh, Jethro and Abhishek were all super helpful for many of the workshops.
In the end, we collectively taught hundreds of people how to solder,
and in the process, also make a customizable badge.
